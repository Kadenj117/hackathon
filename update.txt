as you can tell i did a complete refactor of the code so now the pointer is working correctly however in some sites the pointer is centered
correctly and others it is offset and i dont know why. if you want to spend some time working on it then you could try to fix that or 
you could try to work on adding different colors to the cursor even though i have no idea how to start. you could also try to create
a trailing div if you want to to add some flare.

Ideas of things you can work on:
  -Try to make a system to change the color of the pointer
  -Try to fix the the offset on some of the websites
  -create a secondary div that trails the first a bit slower to add flare
  -add the ability for the cursor to change color or something when hovering over a button or link
  - feel free to try other things if those are to difficult or unintersting(I couldnt get them to work)


  p.s by the way the the manifest.json is very fragile be carefulr messing with it
